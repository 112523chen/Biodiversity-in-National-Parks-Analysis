# Biodiversity-in-National-Parks-Analysis

## **Introduction**
---

The goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, with special emphasis on the various species observed in the different national Park locations.

This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis

Here are a few questions that this project intends to answer
- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
- Are certain species more likely to be endangered?
- Which animal is most common and what is their distribution amongst the parks?
- Are the difference between species and their conservation status significant?

**Data Sources:**
Both `Observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` was provided by Codecademy

*Note*: The data within this project is inspired by real data and doesn't 100 percent accurately describe the real data in the real world

### Project Goals

Within this project, the main goal is to understand the characteristics of the species within the national parks and their conservations status, and the relationship between these species and the national parks.

### Data

Within this project, there are two data sets we be working with. The first file, `Observations.csv`, has information about each species in the nation parks. The second file, `Species_info.csv`, has information about each species in general, like their conservation status.

### Analysis

Through the use of descriptive statistics techniques, data visualization techniques, and statistical inference, the following will be found:

- Distributions
- Counts
- Relationship between species
- Conservation status of species
- Observations of species in parks


## **Conclusions**
---
Within this project, several data visualizations and inferences about the various in four of the National Parks presented in this data set

Some of the questions that were able to be answered now:

- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?

    > The major of species without data set where not part of conservation: 191 were and 5,633 weren't.

- Are certain species more likely to be endangered?

    > Birds and Mammals had the highest percentage of being in protection.

- Which animal is most common and what is their distribution amongst the parks?

    > Through analysis, bats were founded to be that most common animal which the majority of bats in our data set residing in Yellowstone National Park.
    
- Are the difference between species and their conservation status significant?
    > There are some cases such as for mammals and reptiles and Reptile Nonvascular Plant

## Future Research:
---
- How does this screenshot of 7 days compare to the bigger screen of time: 30 days, 6 months, or 1 year?

- Using other datasets, what makes certain species more likely to be endangered?
